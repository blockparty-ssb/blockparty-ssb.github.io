            <h2>How to setup a new community space?</h2>
                <p>Setting up a new community space is not difficult, but might feel unusual, if you are new to dezentralized networks.</p> 
                <p>What you need to do:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Give your new network / community space / community a smashing name</li>
                        <li>make an account on digital ocean.</li>
                    </ul>
            <h2>Why do I have to make an account on Digital Ocean?</h2>
                <p>Digital Ocean is a hosting company and will host your <em>pub</em>. This pub is like an <em>all-the-time-online group member</em> which task is to replicate all of your and your friends messages - like a post office which delivers the letters to all the receivers. 
                    Without this pub, exchanging messages would take a very long time and only happen if you and your friends are online at the same time.
                    Each community space has its own pub. If you want to start another community space you need to setup another pub.</p>
            <h2>Does it cost any money?</h2>
                <p>Using blockparty is for free, as it is non-commercial and open source software. 
                    Using Digital Ocean as host for your pub does cost depending on how much data storage you use. 
                    For 1GB you will pay $5/month. For detailed information, please check the <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/pricing/">pricing</a>.
                    You will need to choose a payment method (credit card or paypal) and add your card data or your paypal account respectively.</p>
            <h2>How to create and access my DigitalOcean token?</h2>
                <p>Personal access tokens function like a combined name and password for API authentication. You will need the token al the time you create a new blockparty community. 
                    When logged in into your Digital Ocean account, follow <a href="https://cloud.digitalocean.com/account/api/tokens/">this link</a> and generate a new token. Name it as you like. 
                    After creating the token, copy and save it on your computer, as it will not be shown again. 
                    If you loose your API key, you can always create a new one.</p>
           <h2>How can I invite my friends to join my community?</h2> 
                <p> After you successfully created your community you can invite your friends to join. 
                    To invite people you need to create an invite token and share it with your friends. </p>
            <h2>I got an invite! What to do with it?</h2>
                <p>To join the community you are invited to you need to:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Download the blockparty app from our website and open it</li>
                        <li>Paste the invite code into the related field</li>
                        <li>Confirm by clicking 'Join an existing blockparty community'</li>
                        <li>In the sidebar you will see the icon of your community</li>
                        <li>The synchronization of your communities messages will take some time. Go and have a delicious cup of coffee while waiting!</li>
                        <li>After that you are ready to go! Give yourself a community name and write your first message!</li>
                    </ol>
