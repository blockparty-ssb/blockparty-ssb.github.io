      <h1>What is blockparty?</h1>
        <h2>Reclaim Your Social Network!</h2>
          <p>blockparty is a social network desktop application that lets you set up your own social network without ever touching any code. With blockparty, you can</p>
            <ul>
              <li>create a safe space for your family to share thoughts, news, and media</li>
              <li>set up a communication platform for your community</li>
              <li>be part of multiple networks in the same application</li>
            </ul>  
        <h2>Not another Facebook!</h2>
          <p>Unlike Facebook and other platforms, the control over your data stays where it belongs: 
            in your hands. blockparty is dezentralized, which means all the data you share is on infrastructure 
            that you control. This setup is the opposite of Facebook, which stores all of the data on Facebook’s 
            infrastructure. blockparty is also encrypted, which means that communication between you and your friends 
            is protected.<br>

          </p>
        <h2>How does this work?</h2>
          <p>blockparty is an out-of-the-box solution that allows its users to easily create their own decentralized, encrypted social network and invite others to join.

              To us, easy setup means a setup with few technical hurdles and good usability, so that more people can join the movement to take back control over their data.
              
              We’re building this free and open source project as a community effort because we believe in non-commercial, neutral,
              and fair communication for everyone. Our goal is to make decentralized networks user friendly and accessible 
              for more people, even for the less technically savvy!</p>
