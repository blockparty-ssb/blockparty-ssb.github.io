      <h2 class="h2">What is blockparty?</h2>
      <p class="body">blockparty is going to be an out-of-the-box desktop application that allows users to easily create their own decentralized, encrypted social network and invite others to join.<br>Unlike Facebook for example, infrastructure and control over the data stay where they belong: in the hands of the users.<br><br>We use the secure-scuttlebutt protocol as starting point, but with blockparty it will be easier for non-technical people to start their own SSB-based network/group a.k.a blockparty.<br>For us, easy setup means a setup with few technical hurdles and good usability, so that anyone can join.<br><br>Our goal is to make decentralized networks user friendly and therefore accessible for more people, even for the less technically savvy!<br><br>blockparty leaves it up to users what they want their block party to be: social network, forum or family room.<br>We&#x27;re building this free and open source project as a community effort because we believe in non-commercial, neutral, and fair mobile communication for everyone.</p>
